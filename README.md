# Cloak+ for UserSpice

This plugin improves the built in cloaking for UserSpice by adding a helper function to cloak with a number of options, and a logout hook to use this as a secondary method of returning to the original user.

## Features

- Callable function for easy cloaking with security checks
- Automatic redirection after cloaking
- Storage and redirection to original destination after cloaking session ended
- Logout button will double as an uncloak button
- Function option overrides including master account check skips, and modifications to the plugins core features

UserSpice can be downloaded from their [website](https://userspice.com/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/mudmin/UserSpice5).

## Example Usage

The `CloakPlus_Cloak` function will return a `state` which can be accessed through the `array`, and in the event the `state` is `false`, it likely will return an `error` as well. If cloaking is successful, the plugin will redirect the user automatically to the homepage. If you disable this, it will return a `state` of `true`. The `state` will always be a `boolean`.

### Basic Usage

```php
# Placeholder Variables
$userId = 100;
$errors = [];

$cloak = CloakPlus_Cloak($userId);
if (!$cloak['state']) {
    $errors[] = $cloak['error'] ?? 'There was an error processing your request';
}
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Disable Logout Uncloak Feature

```php
# Placeholder Variables
$userId = 100;
$errors = [];

$cloak = CloakPlus_Cloak($userId, ['disable_logout_uncloak']);
if (!$cloak['state']) {
    $errors[] = $cloak['error'] ?? 'There was an error processing your request';
}
```

#### Skip Master Check (Allows Other Users)

```php
# Placeholder Variables
$userId = 100;
$errors = [];

$cloak = CloakPlus_Cloak($userId, ['skip_master_check']);
if (!$cloak['state']) {
    $errors[] = $cloak['error'] ?? 'There was an error processing your request';
}
```

#### Preventing Redirect Loops During Uncloaking

In some instances, the URL you may have cloaked from could cause a redirect loop if you use URL parameters to trigger the cloaking. For example, if you cloak from https://example.com/user/bobsmith/cloak/, it will cause a redirect loop. If you still want to redirect them back to a URL other than the homepage however, you can do this by setting the `REQUEST_URI` to something else. In the above URL, we'll want to drop the `cloak/`, so we'll do that using the below code:

```php
# Placeholder Variables
$userId = 100;
$errors = [];

$request_uri_override = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$request_uri_override = explode('cloak/', $request_uri_override);
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $request_uri_override[0];

$cloak = CloakPlus_Cloak($userId, ['skip_master_check']);
if (!$cloak['state']) {
    $errors[] = $cloak['error'] ?? 'There was an error processing your request';
}
```

If you simply want to strip out regular URL parameters, eg. `?cloak=1`, we'll do this:

```php
# Placeholder Variables
$userId = 100;
$errors = [];

$request_uri_override = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
$request_uri_override = explode('?', $request_uri_override);
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $request_uri_override[0];

$cloak = CloakPlus_Cloak($userId, ['skip_master_check']);
if (!$cloak['state']) {
    $errors[] = $cloak['error'] ?? 'There was an error processing your request';
}
```

Note, anything else that depends on `REQUEST_URI` before the user is redirected into the cloaked session will be using this new URI that you set. This is the only way to handle a modified redirection at the time of writing, however.
